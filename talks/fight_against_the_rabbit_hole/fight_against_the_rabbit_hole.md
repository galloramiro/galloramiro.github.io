## Fight against the rabit hole

---

## What is the rabbit hole? 
The rabbit hole could be several things, but it's mostly what happen when you start going down into something with out mutch control.
Usually this happens when we are trying to:
- Fix something (yes, this +99 tabs open... )
- Understand some extrange code (yes, this click from function to funtion to function and then... you are lost... and start again...)
- Solve an unclear ticket (yes, trying to imagine what bussines or the deveolper that wrote that ticket was trying to say...)
- Find  a solution in a group meeting (yes, this meetings that take far much more of the schedule time...)
- And I bet you can find a lot more examples

DISCLAIMER: this is ok, this is normal, this is part of the learning process of each person, so dont be afraid if you feel more than releated to this situations

## How can we fight against this?
I usually find 2 good ways of fighting against this:
- Preventive
- In the $h!t


## Preventive
- How can I see the future and predict a rabbit hole? 
- Am I a genius and I didn't know? 
- Do I have super powers and I didn't know? 

DISCLAIMER: No... you are a human, but you could see this way before it happens


### Refinement: best place to work in a preventive way
- Ask for AC that:
  - Can be used to create a test
  - Can be used by other to understand if the ticket if complete
- Ask for dev resoruces:
  - In what micro-service this need to be done?
  - Where is the main function, class that need to be modified
  - Did we implement something similar? can you show me a PR?
  - Do this feature have a flow diagram?
  - Do this feature have a document that I can use as a guide?
  - Do this feature have a test plan?
  - What are the upstream service impacted?
  - What are the downstream services involved?


### Yep... I know...
But... Ramiro... Im a shy person, I dont like to speak in public
So... we can always ask for the tickets before hand and leave questions right there

But.. Ramiro... I dont like to leave a lot of coment here and there? 
So.. we can always use the PC that a coworker left un-blocked when he went to the bathroom... 

But... Ramiro... if I ask all this questions the team is gonna hate me...
Yes and no... the team would maby hate you at first, but love to work with tickets like that.

But... Ramiro... if I ask all this questions the refinement would never finish.
Maybe you would need to re schedule a new refinement the first times.
Maybe the team would be able to refine less tickets at first time.
But, with time, the tickets would start coming more completed and the time would be less and you would work in a happier way.



### Working with unclear tickets
And all of the suden privi biri biri biri biri bi...
Unclear ticket appear... what do I do? 
Destroy de computer! No...
Shout! No...

There is no need to do any of that hahah


### The power of questions
Use the ticket comments to:
- Make a list of questions of what you dont understand
  - Try to answer thoeses questions
  - Write who can answer the questions
- Write the steps that you think would take to solve this
  - Write the person that can validate this
- Do I have questions for other teams? 
  - Use the help channels to post clear an consise questions
- Create 15m meetings with the people that can help you and
  - Send comment with the questions before the meeting
  - Follow the questions to improve your thinking
  - Take notes and confirm with them before leaving the meeting
  - Post the comment with the answers and ask them for a thumbs up


## In the $h!t show
- Did you write a list of steps to solve this? 
  - Re read that, sometimes we just lost focus
- Use TDD 
  - Make code small
  - Advance by doing baby tested steps 
- Left coments on the code with what you tried 
  - 1 try to filter by using the date column and I dont get what I expect
  - 2 try to filter by combining the date and the value and i dont get what I expect
  - 3 realize that we where missing some indexes and we dont get what we expect either
  - 4 im completly lost nothing works 
- Pair my friend, pair with someone else
  - use your notes
  - explain the problem to someone else

You would not belive how many times the solution would come from talking out loud to someone else.


## Endless meetings
- Be active
- Take notes 
- Ask questions to clarify what you are not understanding
- when you have 5 minutes
  - read your notes
  - confirm mutual understanding
  - write new questions
  - offer scheduling a new meeting


## Do I manage to implement each of this things every day?
NO!
But when I do I work happier and spent more time in the flow :heart_hand
