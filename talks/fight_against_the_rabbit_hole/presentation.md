## What is the rabbit hole? 

The rabbit hole could be several things, but mostly it's what happen when you are falling into a situation with out mutch control.

### Where I ussually find rabbit holes? 

--

### Trying to fix something 

yes... the +99 tabs open... {class="fragment"}

--

### Trying to understand code 

yes... the endles click from function to function, from class to class {class="fragment"}

--

### Trying to understand an unclear ticket 

yes... decoding what that person mean... {class="fragment"}

--

### Trying to find a solution in a group meeting 

yes... the endless meetings that jump from one point to the other... {class="fragment"}

--

### And I bet you can find a lot more examples..

--

<span style="color:red">DISCLAIMER</span>
- This is ok {class="fragment"}
- This is normal {class="fragment"}
- This is part of the learning process of each person {class="fragment"}
- So dont be afraid if you feel more than releated to this situations {class="fragment"}
- I know that I do... {class="fragment"}

---

### Let's talk about some solutions
I usually find 2 ways to fight againts this
- A preventive way {class="fragment"}
- A insitu way {class="fragment"}


---

## The preventive way

--

### Let's start by doing some questions
- Do we have the power to see the future an predict a rabbit hole? {class="fragment"}
- Are we geniusies and we didn't know? {class="fragment"}
- Do we have super powers and we didn't know? {class="fragment"}

--

No... you we are just humans, but we could see this way before it happens, and this is how I TRY to doit.

### Ticket Refinement
This would become one of your best friends

--

### Ask for acceptance criteras that can be used to
- Create a test {class="fragment"}
- Understand if the ticket if complete {class="fragment"}

--

### Ask for dev resoruces
- This belong to... what micro service? {class="fragment"}
- This belong to... what function, or class? {class="fragment"}
- Do we have PR's with similar things? {class="fragment"}
- Do this feature have a flow diagram? {class="fragment"}
- Do this feature have a document? {class="fragment"}
- Do this feature have a test plan? {class="fragment"}
- What are the upstream service impacted? {class="fragment"}
- What are the downstream services involved? {class="fragment"}

#### Yep... I know... I know..

--

But... Ramiro... Im a shy person, I dont like to speak in public 

So... we can always ask for the tickets before hand and leave questions right there {class="fragment"}

--

But.. Ramiro... I dont like to leave a lot of coment here and there? 

So.. we can always use the PC that a coworker left un-blocked when he went to the bathroom... {class="fragment"}

--

But... Ramiro... if I ask all this questions the team is gonna hate me...

Yes and no...{class="fragment"}

The team would maby hate you at first, but love to work with tickets like that. {class="fragment"}

--

But... Ramiro... if I ask all this questions the refinement would never finish.

Maybe you would need to re schedule a new refinement the first times. {class="fragment"}

Maybe the team would be able to refine less tickets at first time. {class="fragment"}

But, with time, the tickets would start coming more completed and the time would be less and you would work in a happier way. {class="fragment"}

### Unclear ticket appear... {class="fragment"}

--

### Should I...

- Destroy de computer!? {class="fragment"}

No.. There is no need to do any of that hahah {class="fragment"}

<img src="https://github.com/galloramiro/galloramiro.github.io/blob/main/talks/fight_against_the_rabbit_hole/img/caterpiller_questions.gif?raw=true" width="70%"> 


### The power of questions

--

### Use the ticket comments to
- Make a list of questions of what you dont understand {class="fragment"}
- Try to answer thoeses questions {class="fragment"}
- Write who can answer the questions {class="fragment"}

--

- Write the steps that you think would take to solve this 
- Write the person that can validate this {class="fragment"}

--

### Do planed 15m meetings with the correct people 
- Send comment with the questions before the meeting {class="fragment"}
- Follow the questions to improve your thinking {class="fragment"}
- Take notes and confirm with them before leaving the meeting {class="fragment"}
- Post the comment with the answers and ask them for a thumbs up {class="fragment"}

--

#### And one day I had to implement some of this

<img src="https://github.com/galloramiro/galloramiro.github.io/blob/main/talks/fight_against_the_rabbit_hole/img/questions_on_implementing_ticket.png?raw=true" width="80%"> {class="fragment"}

--


### Questions for other teams? 
- Use the help channels to post clear an consise questions {class="fragment"}
- Use the ticket to link the threads {class="fragment"}
- Bother people {class="fragment"}
- If no answer, laverage your amazing manager {class="fragment"}

### slay the jabberwocky

--

Did you write a list of steps to solve this?

Let's read that, sometimes we just lost focus {class="fragment"}

--

#### Use TDD 

- Baby steps {class="fragment"}
- And test doeses steps {class="fragment"}

--

#### Left coments on the code with what you tried 
1. try to filter by using the date column and I dont get what I expect {class="fragment"}
2.  try to filter by combining the date and the value and i dont get what I expect {class="fragment"}
3. realize that we where missing some indexes and we dont get what we expect either {class="fragment"}
4. Im completly lost nothing works {class="fragment"}

--

## Pair up my friend
- Explain the problem to someone else {class="fragment"}
- Use your notes {class="fragment"}
- You dont need to know it all {class="fragment"}

You would not belive how many times the solution would come from just talking out loud. {class="fragment"}

--

<img src="https://github.com/galloramiro/galloramiro.github.io/blob/main/talks/fight_against_the_rabbit_hole/img/tea_party.gif?raw=true" width="80%">

--

## Endless meetings

- Be active {class="fragment"}
- Take notes {class="fragment"}
- Ask questions to clarify what you are not understanding {class="fragment"}
- When you have 5 minutes {class="fragment"}
  - Read your notes {class="fragment"}
  - Confirm mutual understanding {class="fragment"}
  - Write new questions {class="fragment"}
  - Offer scheduling a new meeting {class="fragment"}

---


### Do I manage to implement each of this things every day?
NO! {class="fragment"}

But when I do I work happier and spent more time in the flow {class="fragment"}
